# 🔐 KnoxKey – Smart Door Lock with Knock & Keypad Authentication

## 📌 Project Overview

**KnoxKey** is a **product-oriented smart door lock system** developed as an extension of the *Secret Door Lock with Knock Pattern Recognition* project during **Complementary Semester 2**. The system introduces a **dual-layer authentication mechanism** by combining **knock-pattern recognition** with **keypad-based password entry**, significantly enhancing security and usability for real-world applications.

Unlike the earlier prototype-focused implementation, this phase emphasized **complete product development**, including **schematic design, PCB layout, enclosure considerations, and hardware validation**, transforming the concept into a deployable embedded product.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a dual-authentication smart door lock system
* Integrate knock-based and keypad-based access control
* Develop a compact and reliable PCB-based hardware solution
* Implement user-configurable reset and reprogramming modes
* Ensure robustness against noise, false triggers, and misuse

---

## ⚙️ System Working Principle

1. The system remains in a locked state by default
2. User authentication can be performed using:

   * **Knock Pattern Recognition**, or
   * **Keypad Password Entry**
3. Knock signals are captured via a piezoelectric sensor and filtered to suppress noise
4. Keypad inputs are scanned and validated by the microcontroller
5. The authentication logic verifies:

   * Timing pattern for knocks, or
   * Correct password sequence from keypad
6. Upon successful authentication:

   * The relay/solenoid lock is actuated to unlock the door
   * System status is displayed on the I2C LCD
7. A **reset/configuration mode** allows authorized users to update knock patterns and passwords

## 🔧 Key Features

* Dual authentication: knock pattern + keypad password
* User-configurable reset mode for knock pattern and password
* Piezoelectric knock sensing with noise filtering
* Custom-designed PCB for compact and reliable operation
* I2C-based 16×2 LCD for system status and user guidance
* Relay/solenoid-based electronic locking mechanism
* LED indicators for operational feedback
* Designed with scalability and product reliability in mind
